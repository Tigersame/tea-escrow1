Today, we’re calling on the believers, the builders, the bold. If you know the power of open source — its ability to spark innovation, accelerate progress, and unite creators across the globe — then you’re already one of us.

Open source is the world’s greatest collective achievement. At Tea, we’re proving that its true value doesn’t belong to any one person — it belongs to the crowd. To you.

So whether you’re a Web3 native, a GitHub lurker, a CLI warrior, or someone just discovering what open source means — there’s a place for you here.

We’re building an ecosystem where contributions are more than code — they’re currency. Where intelligence, creativity, and impact are recognized, secured, and rewarded. Help open source thrive in the next era of computing because open source is our future, and it’s time we built it together.

Stand with us. Stake your belief. Share the reward.

Join Tea — because open source is our shared future.
